<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To develop your own tasks or to run your own instance of Tatool in your lab, you'll have setup your local environment first. The following steps guide you through this process. Note that you have to complete this setup on one machine only even if you want to run Tatool on multiple machines in your lab. As long as your network settings allow for it, other machines can access Tatool via a standard web browser.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/app/tatool_logo.png" width="200"><br><br>Get the latest download of Tatool from our <a href="http://github.com/tatool/tatool-web" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. If you're familiar with Git, we recommend you clone the tatool-web repository, otherwise you can simply download a ZIP file by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button in the top menu on GitHub.</p>

<p>After having downloaded/extracted the tatool-web code to where you want to run Tatool from, you'll have to run a few commands to properly install all dependencies.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Open the folder where you downloaded and extracted tatool-web to in your terminal window.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$> cd tatool-web
</code></pre>

<p><b>2.</b> Enter the first command to install the <b>bower plugin</b> for nodejs. Bower is used to automatically download all dependencies.<br>
The second command checks whether your installation of bower was successful. If you don't see the version of bower, something went wrong with your installation and you'll have to fix it first.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$tatool-web> npm install -g bower
...
$tatool-web> bower -version
1.7.2
</code></pre>

<p><b>3.</b> Enter the first command to install the <b>gulp plugin</b> for nodejs. Gulp is used to build tatool-web.<br>
The second command checks whether your installation of gulp was successful. If you don't see the version of gulp, something went wrong with your installation and you'll have to fix it first.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$tatool-web> npm install -g gulp
...
$tatool-web> gulp -version
[20:38:17] CLI version 3.8.8
[20:38:17] Local version undefined
</code></pre>

<p><b>4.</b> Run <b>npm install</b> to install Tatool. The command will run bower to download all dependencies and gulp to build the code. On Mac OSX you might need to run this with the <b>sudo</b> command. The installation might take a while the first time. You might also need to run it twice for the first time to make sure everything gets downloaded and built.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$tatool-web> npm install
...

    <p>In case you see a bunch of <b>ECONNRESET</b> error messages during your installation you can run the following command first to make sure node is using the correct URL to download all dependencies:

<h3 id="runTatool">Run Tatool<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>The following steps are needed to execute your local Tatool environment. You'll need to follow these steps every time you want to start your local instance of Tatool.</p>

<p><b>1.</b> Start <b>mongoDB</b> (if you haven't already done so in an earlier step) by first changing into the mongoDB directory using the <i>cd</i> command followed by the full path where you installed the mongoDB into. Don't close the terminal afterwards, as this will kill the process running your database. If you chose a different data directory during the installation, you'll need to provide the dbpath argument (without the brackets [ ]).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$> cd mongodb
$mongodb> cd bin
$mongodb\bin> mongod --dbpath [your data directory path]
...waiting for connections on port 27017
</code></pre>

<p><b>2.</b> Start <b>nodejs</b> in a new terminal by executing the commands below. First you'll have to change into the directory where you extracted tatool-web to. The second command will start a local web server hosting Tatool. Don't close the terminal, as this will kill the process running your server.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">$> cd tatool-web
$tatool-web> npm start
...

You can access tatool on hostname:3000
Running tatool in LAB mode.
</code></pre>

<p><b>3.</b> Access your Tatool instance by opening the url <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:3000</a> in your browser. You should now see the Tatool start page.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>Remember that your local instance of tatool-web has <i>nothing</i> to do with the instance running on tatool-web.com and no data is shared between the instances.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><b>4.</b> If this is your first time starting Tatool, you can login with the default admin user:</p>
<p><b>Email:</b> admin@tatool-web.com<br><b>Password:</b> 1234</p>

<p><b>Change the admin password immediately</b> by going to the Admin tab and clicking on the change password button next to the user 'admin@tatool-web.com'. You can also start adding your lab users in the admin tab by clicking on the 'Add user' button.</p>
